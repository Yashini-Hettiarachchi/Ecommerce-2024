# Ecommerce-2024

*Ecommerce-2024* is a simple online store web application developed as part of my academic project at SLIIT. The system allows users to browse products, while admin users can manage product listings and view customer orders.

This project helped me practice full-stack development using MERN Stack and backend API testing using Postman.
